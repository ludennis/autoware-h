 <br/>       
A behavior tree library in `C++`.

I am working with [Davide Faconti](https://github.com/facontidavide) on a new version of this library. The new version will have better graphic user interface and it will be the core module for the ROS version and the YARP version of this library.

REFERENCE
------------
Please refer to the following paper when using the library:

BT NODES SUPPORT
----------------
**Fallback:** Fallback nodes are used to find and execute the first child that does not fail. A Selector node will return immediately with a status code of success or running when one of its children returns success or running. The children are ticked in order of importance, from `left` to `right`.

**Sequence:** Sequence nodes are used to find and execute the first child that has not yet succeeded. A sequence node will return immediately with a status code of `failure` or `running` when one of its children returns failure or running. The children are ticked in order, from `left` to `right`.

**Parallel:** The parallel node ticks its children in parallel and returns success if `M ≤ N` children return success, it returns failure if `N − M + 1` children return failure, and it returns running otherwise.

**Decorator:** The decorator node manipulates the return status of its child according to the policy defined by the user (e.g. it inverts the success/failure status of the child). In this library the decorators implemented are the two common ones: *Decorator Retry* which retries the execution of a node if this fails; and *Decorator Negation* That inverts the Success/Failure outcome.

**Action:** An Action node performs an action, and returns Success if the action is completed, Failure if it can not be completed and Running if completion is under way.

**Condition:** A Condition node determines if a desired condition `c` has been met. Conditions are technically a subset of the Actions, but are given a separate category and graphical symbol to improve readability of the BT and emphasize the fact that they never return running and do not change any internal states/variables of the BT.

A user manual is available in the project folder ([BTppUserManual.pdf](https://github.com/miccol/Behavior-Tree/blob/master/BTppUserManual.pdf)).

SETUP
-----------

The first step to use BT++ is to retrieve its source code. You can either download it 
here (https://github.com/miccol/Behavior-Tree) or clone the repository:

`$ cd /path/to/folder` <br/>
`$ git clone https://github.com/miccol/Behavior−Tree.git`

Once you have the repository, compile the library:

`$ cd /path/to/folder/` <br/>
`$ mkdir ./build` <br/>
`$ cd build` <br/>
`$ cmake ..` <br/>
`$ make` <br/>


**NOTE**
In case you get the following error:

`CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
GLUT_Xmu_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)`

please see solution [here](https://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1703770.html). Thanks [miquelramirez](https://github.com/miquelramirez) for this.


Check the installation by running a sample example.

`$ cd /path/to/folder/` <br/>
`$ cd build/sample` <br/>
`$ ./btpp_example` <br/>

INSTALL THE LIBRARY SYSTEM-WIDE (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04)
-------------------------------

If you would like to install the library system-wide, then run:

`$ cd /path/to/folder/` <br/>
`$ cd build` <br/>
`$ sudo make install` <br/>

On Ubuntu, this will install the library (libbtpp.so) in `/usr/local/lib`. <br/>
In an external project, just call in your CMakeLists 'find_package(BTpp)' to find the library. <br/>
The include directory is defined as `BTpp_INCLUDE_DIRS` and the libraries to link as `BTpp_LIBRARIES`.<br/>
The repository [my-behavior-tree-project](https://github.com/miccol/my-behavior-tree-project) shows an example on how to use the library once system-wide installed.


CREATE YOUR OWN ACTION NODE
------
1) Implement your action node class extending the abstract class `BT::ActionNode`.
2) Implement the method `BT::ReturnStatus Tick()` with the code you want to execute while the action is running. Use the method `is_halted()` to check if the action has been prempted. When the execution of your action finished, return `BT::SUCCESS` or `BT::FAILURE` accordingly.  
3) Implement the method `void Halt()` with the code you want to execute when the action gets preempted (halted).
See the file `src/example.cpp` for an example.

CREATE YOUR OWN CONDITION NODE
------
1) Implement your condition node class extending the abstract class `BT::ConditionNode`.
2) Implement the method `BT::ReturnStatus Tick()` with the code you want to execute to check the condition. Return `BT::SUCCESS` or `BT::FAILURE` accordingly.  
See the file `src/example.cpp` for an example.


NOTES
-------
In case you are puzzled about why a sequence (or fallback) node with 2 or more actions as children never get past the first action, see [this](https://github.com/miccol/ROS-Behavior-Tree/issues/16) discussion.
